This Gradle error message indicates a problem with resolving dependencies for your Android application, specifically related to Capacitor plugins. The core of the issue is:"No matching variant of project :capacitor-android (and other capacitor plugins) was found."This means Gradle couldn't find a version of these Capacitor library projects that matches the requirements of your main :app module. The requirements it's looking for include:•com.android.build.api.attributes.AgpVersionAttr with value 8.7.2: Your app module is using Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) version 8.7.2.•com.android.build.api.attributes.BuildTypeAttr with value debug: You're trying to build the debug variant of your app.•org.jetbrains.kotlin.platform.type with value androidJvm: Your app module is configured for Kotlin on Android JVM.The error "No variants exist" for each Capacitor plugin suggests that these library projects are not configured in a way that Gradle can understand or they are missing necessary build configurations.Here's a breakdown of common causes and how to troubleshoot them:1. Capacitor/Cordova Project Misconfiguration:•Outdated Capacitor/Cordova: Ensure your Capacitor CLI and related plugins are up-to-date. Outdated versions might not be compatible with newer AGP versions.•Run npx cap update in your project's root directory.•Check the documentation for each Capacitor plugin you're using to ensure compatibility.•Incorrect variables.gradle: Capacitor projects often use a variables.gradle file in the root of the Android project (usually android/variables.gradle) to define versions for AndroidX libraries, Kotlin, and other dependencies. Ensure these versions are compatible with AGP 8.7.2 and the versions used by your Capacitor plugins.•AGP 8.x often requires updated versions of common libraries. For example, you might need to update:•compileSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion in your app's build.gradle.•Kotlin version (kotlinVersion in variables.gradle or project-level build.gradle).•AndroidX library versions (e.g., coreVersion, appcompatVersion, etc. in variables.gradle).•Missing or Incorrect Plugin Initialization: Ensure that the Capacitor plugins are correctly installed and synced with your native Android project.•Run npx cap sync android after making any changes to plugins or dependencies.2. Gradle Build Files in Capacitor Plugin Modules:•The build.gradle file within each Capacitor plugin module (e.g., capacitor-android/build.gradle, capacitor-app/build.gradle) might be missing necessary configurations to make them compatible as library modules.•Ensure they apply the com.android.library plugin:// In capacitor-android/build.gradle (and other plugin modules)
plugins {
    id 'com.android.library'
    id 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.android' // If the plugin uses Kotlin
}•Check compileSdkVersion, minSdkVersion, targetSdkVersion: These should be consistent or compatible with your main app module.•Variant Awareness: Modern AGP versions are more stringent about variant matching. The library modules need to publish variants that your app module can consume. This usually happens automatically if they are standard Android library modules.3. Inconsistent AGP Versions:•While the error specifies your :app module uses AGP 8.7.2, it's crucial that the Capacitor library modules are also built with a compatible AGP version. If they are subprojects within your main Android project, they should ideally inherit the AGP version from the root project's build.gradle file.•Check the build.gradle files of the Capacitor plugin modules to see if they are overriding the AGP version.4. settings.gradle Configuration:•Ensure that your settings.gradle file correctly includes the Capacitor library projects. It should look something like this:// settings.gradle
include ':app'
include ':capacitor-android'
include ':capacitor-app'
include ':capacitor-haptics'
include ':capacitor-keyboard'
include ':capacitor-status-bar'

project(':capacitor-android').projectDir = new File('../node_modules/@capacitor/android/capacitor')
project(':capacitor-app').projectDir = new File('../node_modules/@capacitor/app/android')
project(':capacitor-haptics').projectDir = new File('../node_modules/@capacitor/haptics/android')
project(':capacitor-keyboard').projectDir = new File('../node_modules/@capacitor/keyboard/android')
project(':capacitor-status-bar').projectDir = new File('../node_modules/@capacitor/status-bar/android')(The paths might vary slightly based on your project structure and Capacitor version.)5. Clean and Rebuild:•Sometimes, old build artifacts can cause issues.•In Android Studio: Build > Clean Project•In Android Studio: Build > Rebuild Project•Or from the command line: ./gradlew clean :app:assembleDebug6. Gradle Version:•The log mentions "Deprecated Gradle features were used... incompatible with Gradle 9.0." and you are using Gradle 8.11.1. While this is likely a separate warning, ensure your Gradle version is compatible with AGP 8.7.2. You can check the AGP release notes for compatibility tables.•Update your Gradle wrapper if necessary by modifying gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties and then running ./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version <new_version>.Troubleshooting Steps:1.Start with npx cap sync android. This often resolves inconsistencies between your web code and the native Android project.2.Verify variables.gradle: Ensure the versions defined here are up-to-date and compatible. Pay close attention to kotlinVersion, AndroidX library versions, and compileSdkVersion/targetSdkVersion.3.Inspect Plugin build.gradle files: Open the build.gradle files for capacitor-android, capacitor-app, etc. (located in node_modules/@capacitor/.../android). Ensure they apply the com.android.library plugin and don't have conflicting configurations.4.Check your app module's build.gradle (app/build.gradle):•Ensure your dependencies block correctly implements these projects:dependencies {
    implementation project(':capacitor-android')
    implementation project(':capacitor-app')
    implementation project(':capacitor-haptics')
    implementation project(':capacitor-keyboard')
    implementation project(':capacitor-status-bar')
    // ... other dependencies
}5.Run Gradle with more info:•./gradlew :app:dependencies --configuration debugCompileClasspath - This will show you the dependency tree and might highlight where the resolution is failing more specifically for the problematic configuration.•./gradlew :app:compileDebugJavaWithJavac --info or ./gradlew :app:compileDebugJavaWithJavac --debug to get more detailed logs.•./gradlew build --scan to generate a build scan, which provides an in-depth look at your build and can be very helpful for diagnosing complex issues.If the problem persists, focus on these key questions:•What versions of Capacitor, AGP, and Gradle are you using?•Have you recently updated any of these?•Can you share the relevant parts of your android/build.gradle, android/app/build.gradle, and android/variables.gradle (if it exists)?•Can you also share the build.gradle from one of the failing Capacitor plugin modules (e.g., node_modules/@capacitor/android/capacitor/build.gradle)?The error "No variants exist" strongly points to a configuration issue within the Capacitor library modules themselves, making them incompatible with how your main app module is trying to consume them.
