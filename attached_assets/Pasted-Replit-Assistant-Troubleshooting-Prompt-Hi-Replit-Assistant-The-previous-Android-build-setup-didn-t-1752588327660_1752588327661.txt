Replit Assistant Troubleshooting Prompt
Hi Replit Assistant! The previous Android build setup didn't work. I need you to help me troubleshoot and fix this step by step.
What Happened
You created several scripts:

setup-android-sdk.sh
build-apk-dev.sh
build-android-complete.sh

But when I ran them, they failed. I need you to help me debug this.
What I Need You To Do RIGHT NOW
1. Check Current Java Status
First, let's see what's actually installed:
bashjava -version
javac -version
echo $JAVA_HOME
which java
2. Manual Java Installation (Step by Step)
If Java isn't working, let's install it manually:
bash# Update package manager
sudo apt-get update

# Install OpenJDK 17
sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk

# Verify installation
java -version
3. Set JAVA_HOME Manually
bash# Find Java installation path
sudo find /usr -name "java" -type f 2>/dev/null | grep bin/java

# Set JAVA_HOME (use the path from above, usually something like /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64)
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

# Verify
echo $JAVA_HOME
java -version
4. Test Basic Android Build
Before setting up the full SDK, let's test if the basic build works:
bash# Build web app
npm run build

# Try basic Capacitor sync
npx cap sync android

# Check if android folder exists
ls -la android/

# Try to run gradlew
cd android
ls -la
./gradlew --version
5. Show Me the Error Messages
When you run these commands, I need you to show me:

The exact error messages
What files exist in the android/ folder
The output of java -version
The output of echo $JAVA_HOME

6. Simple APK Build Test
If Java is working, let's try the simplest APK build:
bashcd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
Questions I Need Answered

What's the exact error message when you run the build commands?
Does the android/ folder exist in my project?
Is Java actually installed and working?
Are there any permission issues with the scripts?
What's in the android/gradlew file - does it exist and is it executable?

Debugging Steps
Please run these commands ONE BY ONE and show me the output:
bash# Check current directory
pwd
ls -la

# Check Java
java -version

# Check Android folder
ls -la android/

# Check gradlew
ls -la android/gradlew

# Check if gradlew is executable
file android/gradlew
What I DON'T Want

Complex scripts that try to do everything at once
Multiple file edits without testing each step
Assumptions about what's working

What I DO Want

Step-by-step debugging
Simple commands that I can run one at a time
Clear error messages and solutions
A working APK at the end

Current Goal
I just want to get ONE successful APK build. Once that works, we can optimize the process. Right now, I need you to:

Diagnose what's actually broken
Fix the Java/JAVA_HOME issue
Test each step individually
Build a working APK

Please start with the diagnostic commands above and show me what's actually happening in my environment right now.
