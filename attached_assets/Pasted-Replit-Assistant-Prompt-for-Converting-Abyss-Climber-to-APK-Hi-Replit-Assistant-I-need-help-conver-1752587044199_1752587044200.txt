Replit Assistant Prompt for Converting Abyss Climber to APK
Hi Replit Assistant! I need help converting my full-stack climbing progression app "Abyss Climber" into an APK file that I can install on my Android phone. Here are the details:

Current App Setup

Configure Vite build settings for mobile
Set up proper Android manifest permissions
Configure app metadata (name, package ID, version)
Set up proper build scripts in package.json
5. Database and API Considerations
Help configure the app to work with my PostgreSQL database
Set up proper API base URLs for mobile
Handle authentication flow for mobile app
Configure environment variables for mobile build
6. Generate the APK
Walk me through the complete build process
Generate a debug APK that I can install on my phone
Test that all features work properly in mobile environment
Provide instructions for installing the APK on my Android device

Questions to Address
How do I handle the backend API in a mobile context?
Should I deploy the backend separately or bundle it somehow?

Current File Structure
My app has a monorepo structure with:

/server - Express backend
/shared - Shared TypeScript types
/database - Drizzle schema and migrations
Various config files for Vite, TypeScript, etc.
Please provide step-by-step instructions and help me build a working APK that preserves all the functionality of my web app while being optimized for mobile use. If you need to see any specific files or configurations, please let me know and I'll share them.

Note: If there are any limitations with building APKs directly in Replit, please suggest alternative approaches or workarounds that would allow me to get my app running on my Android phone.
