Yes, I can help you generate an APK from your Abyss Climber app! I can see you already have Capacitor configured and Android build scripts ready. Let me run the build script to create your APK.

chmod +x build-android.sh && ./build-android.sh
This will:

Build your web app using npm run build
Initialize/sync the Android platform with Capacitor
Copy your web assets to the Android project
Build the APK using Gradle
The script will generate an APK file at android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk that you can install on Android devices.

If you encounter any issues during the build process, we can troubleshoot them. The build process might take a few minutes to complete, especially if it's downloading dependencies for the first time.

oh it failed wouldnt it be easier to use android studio?

Actually, we can build the APK right here in Replit! The build failed because we need to install the Android SDK and set up the build environment. Let me help you get this working without needing to leave Replit.

First, let's try the simpler build script that sets up the project structure:

chmod +x build-android-simple.sh && ./build-android-simple.sh
This will prepare your Android project. Then we can install the Android SDK tools directly in Replit:

wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/commandlinetools-linux-9477386_latest.zip -O android-tools.zip
unzip android-tools.zip -d android-sdk && rm android-tools.zip
export ANDROID_HOME=$PWD/android-sdk && export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
