The quest system needs major fixes and simplification. Here's what I need:

❗ Issues to Fix
🧭 Quest Tab Isolated / Can't Navigate Back

Once I click into the quest system (tabs), I can’t return to other parts of the app

Fix the routing or component logic so users can freely enter and leave the quest screen

Ensure the quest tab doesn’t trap the user — it should behave like any other page or panel

🚫 Weekly & Layer Quests Can’t Be Completed

Completing a weekly or layer quest does nothing — no XP is awarded, and the UI doesn’t update

Fix this:

Make the ✅ button for weekly/layer quests actually mark them as completed

Update XP correctly based on difficulty

Remove the quest from view after completion

🧩 Layer Quest Rules

You should only have 1 Layer Quest per layer

Automatically assign a new Layer Quest when the user enters a new layer (no button needed)

Prevent duplicates for the same layer

Layer Quests should be long and hard — balanced with XP (see below)

⚙️ Automatic Daily & Weekly Quests

Daily and Weekly quests should be:

Automatically generated each day/week

Up to 3 each (no more, no less)

No need for “Generate Quest” or “Completed Quest” UI anymore

Reset times:

Daily: resets at midnight

Weekly: resets every Monday at 00:00

Store timestamp of generation in the backend to prevent double resets

📈 XP Balance & Difficulty Tags

Bring back the difficulty tags and XP scaling system:

Difficulty	Tag	Base XP
Easy	🟢 easy	80 XP
Medium	🟡 medium	120 XP
Hard	🟠 hard	180 XP
Extreme	🔴 extreme	250 XP

Weekly XP = baseXP × 1.5

Layer XP = baseXP × (1.5 + layerIndex × 0.3)

Show the tag and final XP reward visibly on each quest

✅ Quest Completion Behavior

When a quest is completed:

Mark it as completed in the backend

Update the XP immediately

Remove the quest card from the UI

Optionally show a short animation or feedback

✅ Final Goals
Tabs work fluidly (can leave quest view)

Quest types behave correctly

Difficulty and XP are properly balanced

No manual quest generation — the system handles it daily/weekly

UI is clean, readable, and automatically updates on actions
