After resetting user data with the Dev Reset tool, several parts of the app show incorrect values. Please fix the following issues and make sure the app behaves correctly with a clean account (no data yet):

✅ 1. Whistle Rank Should Start at Bell
🔴 Problem: After reset, the user starts as a Red Whistle, even without climbing anything.

✅ Fix:

Set default whistle rank to Bell Whistle (V0) when no climbs are logged yet.

Make the whistle rank logic dynamically depend on the highest grade climbed.

Do not hardcode a default rank beyond Bell.

✅ 2. Average Grade Shows 3 with No Data
🔴 Problem: The Average Grade in the Progress tab shows 3 even when no sessions are logged.

✅ Fix:

When no climbing data exists, display "-" or "N/A" as the average grade.

Ensure average grade is only calculated if at least one session is logged with a valid grade.

✅ 3. Skills Are Missing from Progress Tab
🔴 Problem: After reset, the Skills section in the Progress tab is empty or not rendering properly.

✅ Fix:

Add fallback logic: if no skill data exists, show placeholder UI like “No skills logged yet.”

Reinitialize the skill categories (Movement, Strength, Mind, Technique) to be available even before they’re filled with progress.

Ensure future skill progress logs populate those categories correctly.

✅ 4. “Top Skill” Shows Garbage or Wrong Color
🔴 Problem: The Top Skill text shows the wrong color and doesn’t make sense when no skills are completed yet.

✅ Fix:

Only show “Top Skill” if there is actual skill progress data to base it on.

If not, hide the Top Skill section or show: "Top Skill: N/A"

Fix text color issue:

Apply default color (text-white or text-foreground) if skill category color is undefined.

Sanitize category names before using them in class names or color mappings.

✅ Acceptance Criteria
After a full Dev Reset, the user should:

Start as Bell Whistle

See "N/A" for stats like average grade and top skill until actual data exists

Have default skill categories shown, ready to populate as soon as progress is made

Experience no visual glitches or text color bugs in the progress tab
